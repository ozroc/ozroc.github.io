Summary: About me


I’m a physicist and a Python, Linux and free knowledge enthusiast.

I started my career as a researcher at Grupo de Física Nuclear at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Soon I became interested in the more technical part of the work, related to programming and Linux systems administration.

In 2012 I left the academic world and I started working for BlueTC as an external consultant in Ericsson R&D. There I began to develop my activity mainly as a Python developer of automation systems and testing facilities for continuous integration.

In December 2014 I joined BlueTC's Solutions area, where I started working on diverse projects related to Openstack, NFV/SDN and integrating analytics and data mining solutions within traditional monitoring environments.

Currently, I continue in that department as a Solutions Manager leading projects of various kinds.
