Summary: About me


As a physicist, I started my career at the Nuclear Physics Group in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid where I became interested in the technical part of the work, linked to computational physics and Linux systems management.

In 2012 I left the academic world and I started working for BlueTC as an external consultant in Ericsson R&D. There I began to develop my activity mainly as a Python developer of automation systems and testing facilities for continuous integration.

In December 2014 I joined BlueTC's Solutions area, where I started working on diverse projects related to Openstack, NFV/SDN and integrating analytics solutions with traditional monitoring environments.
